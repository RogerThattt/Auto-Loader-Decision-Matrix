# Auto-Loader-Decision-Matrix
✅ Yes, use Auto Loader when:  Data lands frequently in cloud object storage  You need streaming or micro-batch latency  You expect schema evolution  You need scalable ingestion with high file counts  ❌ No, avoid Auto Loader when:  Data is in RDBMS or event buses (Kafka)


When to Use Each
✅ Use Auto Loader when:
Your market data vendor drops periodic files to cloud (e.g., every 1–5 seconds)

You prefer file-based retention/audit in Delta format

You’re building a DLT Bronze–Silver–Gold pipeline

You can tolerate a latency of 30–90 seconds

You want built-in schema inference and evolution

✅ Use Kafka when:
You have a custom Kafka producer or connect to GlobalDataFeeds real-time stream

You need sub-second latency for analytics, dashboarding, or triggering alerts

You need fine-grained control over messages, retries, offsets

You’re building a real-time trading or pricing engine

Your infra is ready for horizontal scaling with Kafka partitions
